I am a data scientist from the Boston area that enjoys using Python to develop data-driven solutions to solve problems. I have a number of years experience coding in Python and enjoy writing and talking about new data science topics and machine learning algorithms. I love great uses of data vizualizations that tell a compelling story and engage audiences.

My blog is a collection of projects I've worked on and technology related tools or shortcuts that interest me. I enjoy cooking, mixology, music and reading when I feel like relaxing and skiing, soccer, cycling and hiking when I feel like getting some exercise.
